# Page Headings Obsidian Plugin

Obsidian plugin to populate page headings from the filename.

When enabled, any time a blank file is opened, either from having just created it from a wiki link or opening a pre-existing blank file, a Markdown heading will be inserted into the page that is constructed from the filename.

If you build up your notes in a similar fashion to Zettelkasten or like to insert wiki links into a parent page and then click on them to create the child page, and you like to follow the convention of the page heading matching the filename _(like NotePlan)_, this plugin will take of that for you.

## Todo
